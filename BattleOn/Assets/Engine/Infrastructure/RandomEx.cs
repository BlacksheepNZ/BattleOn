            // which means it can only produce 2^32 different sequences of numbers. If such a generator is used to shuffle a deck of 52 playing cards, it can only ever produce a very small 
            // fraction of the 52! ≈ 2^225.6 possible permutations. It's impossible for a generator with less than 226 bits of internal state to produce all the possible permutations of a 52-card deck.
